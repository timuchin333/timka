3.When you perform a git rebase, you are essentially rewriting the commit history. Instead of integrating changes with a merge commit, rebase combines the commit changes into a series of new commits applied on top of another branch. This can result in a cleaner and linear history.
4.Local branches are listed without a prefix, while remote branches are prefixed with the remote's name, such as origin/branch-name. For example, a local branch might be displayed as master, and a remote branch as origin/feature-branch.
